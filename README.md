Project Title: Cuda Particels
Project Wiki:
https://github.com/OltersdorfTechnology/CudaParticals/wiki

Project Goal:

Enables the use of NIVIDA CUDA for Large realistic Particle Simulations in Blender 3D

	SHALL Have working beta release by end of 2020
	Should auto check / install CUDA (with chocolatey)
	Should auto warn non CUDA Device
	SHALL use Blender Nodes
	Should use current blender force modifiers
	SHALL use GitHub for Source Control / Versioning
	Should be able to switch between "Artistic / Engineering" modes, controls float point precision
	Should Out Put Graph Plots for: Velocity through narrow volume over time, Number of Particles in volume over time,…
	SHALL change particle colors / intensity with velocity
	Should use standard blender frame rate / animation settings for "Artistic" mode
	SHALL use new frame rate / animation settings for "Engineering" mode
	Should select between ram cache and Disk Cache
	Should have option to "Bake" sim 
		- Enabling background simulation  without display port updates
	Should Allow for multiple "systems" to interact with each other on a selectable basis
	SHALL accommodate multiple external / internal self effecting forces
		- Photons, Magnetic, Charge, Gravity

Limiting Scope to:
	- Plasma particles 
		○ Charged Particles
	- Non Newtonian
	- No fluids, gasses, …
